We want to create a bootable partition and a file system on it for Vanilla Linux to run.

Host OS (Debian 9 "sid") was installed on the entire disk of my Chromebook (16 GB) using a single ext4 partition and a swap partition.
So I'll have to shrink the host system partition to make room for Vanilla Linux.
